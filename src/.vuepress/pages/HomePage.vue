    <h1 class="!text-3xl">The Continuous Compliance Framework</h1>

    <p>
      The Continuous Compliance Framework (CCF) is an open source, automated compliance testing and reporting system designed
      to help organizations continuously assess their adherence to regulatory standards such as NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2,
      PCI DSS, and GDPR. It integrates policy-based compliance checks, real-time monitoring, and structured reporting to
      streamline the traditionally manual and periodic audit processes.

    <h1 class="!text-3xl">ðŸ”Œ Seamless Integration with Your Stack</h1>

    <h2 class="!text-lg">Bring Your Own Systems â€” Weâ€™ll Handle the Compliance</h2>

    <p>
      The CCF agent and plugin architecture integrates directly into your existing cloud, SDLC, and infrastructure. Whether you're on AWS, GCP, GitHub, or self-hosted, CCF collects and validates compliance data in real-time â€” without the need for massive rewrites or proprietary tooling.

    <h1 class="!text-3xl">ðŸ§  Built for GRC and Engineers Alike</h1>

    <h2 class="text-lg">Human-Readable Policies. Auditor-Ready Output.</h2>

    <p>
      CCF bridges the gap between your compliance team and your engineering org. GRC professionals can build mappings to frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or SOC 2 â€” while developers plug into our open-source agents and work with policy-as-code using tools like OPA or Kyverno. The result? One source of truth, built for audit.

    <h2 class="text-lg">Stop the Quarterly Panic</h2>

    <p>
      With CCFâ€™s continuous validation and live reporting, your compliance status is always up to date. Dashboards, labels, and structured assessment plans give you visibility across all systems â€” from host-level misconfigurations to SDLC weaknesses â€” before they become audit findings.

    <h2 class="text-lg">From Findings to OSCAL Without the Busy Work</h2>

    <p>
      Every finding, policy result, and assessment in CCF is structured and machine-readable â€” making export to NIST OSCAL formats painless. Automate reporting to auditors, customers, or regulators with confidence and accuracy, powered by real data.

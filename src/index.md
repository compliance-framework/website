# The Continuous Compliance Framework

The Continuous Compliance Framework (CCF) is an open source, automated compliance testing and reporting system designed
to help organizations continuously assess their adherence to regulatory standards such as NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2,
PCI DSS, and GDPR. It integrates policy-based compliance checks, real-time monitoring, and structured reporting to
streamline the traditionally manual and periodic audit processes.
